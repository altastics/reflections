What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

 - Pro: You can go over every change you make, before updating 
        it to a new version
 - Con: It takes more time and effort

  - First type git log to see all to commits made to the file, 
    when you can choose one 2 commits and use git diff commit1 commit2, to see the changes made to the file
