What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 - You get a working space, where you can put all your files, 
   you need for a project. It's for organizing reasons and to be able to easily share it with others.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 - In the staging area, you can still change your files,
   before offering them to others, who have access to the repository.
