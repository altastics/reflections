When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - When I have to work with other people as well, who are in  
   different locations and are working from other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - Because some of the changes made in GitHub might be not good, and better be changed in GitHub before pulling them to local.
